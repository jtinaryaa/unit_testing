# Unit Testing
- This project is all about the Junit , Mockito and MockMVC with Java and Spring.

## Why Testing is required in your project ?
- See, when we write code, we usually test it manually and then deploy it, and it works fine. 
- But when the project grows bigger, with many people working on it and multiple environments.
- we need to automate testing. This way, before deploying the code, we can run all the test cases automatically to ensure everything works as expected and prevent issues.
- Test cases are like checklist to make sure the code works properly. They help catch mistakes early, keep things working when changes are made, and ensure the project stays reliable over time.
